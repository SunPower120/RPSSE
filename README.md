Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game
This is a Java application that simulates the game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and
testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To run the application, you need:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. If you don't have it already, you can download it
here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11 .
The application is tested to work with Java 11.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE), like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Running the Game
Clone or download the project to your local machine.

Open the project in your chosen IDE.

Run the Main class. This is the entry point to the application.

Game Play
On running the application, you'll be asked to input the following:

Your name.

Number of computer players (from 1 up to 9).

Number of rounds (from 1 up to 5).

For each round, you'll need to enter your move. The choices are:

The application will generate moves for the computer players and calculate the results for each round.

At the end of all rounds, the score matrix will be displayed. This matrix shows the results of all games played between
